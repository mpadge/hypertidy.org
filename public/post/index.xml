      <description>This post describes the mesh3d format used in the rgl package and particularly how colour properties are stored and used. There are recent changes to this behaviour (see ‘meshColor’), and previously the situation was not clearly documented.
rgl The rgl package has long provided interactive 3D graphics for R. The neat thing for me about 3D graphics is the requirement for mesh forms of data, and the fact that meshes are extremely useful for very many tasks.</description>

      <title>GDAL in R</title>

      <description>For some time I have used GDAL as a standard tool in my kit, I was introduced to the concept by the rgdal package authors and it slowly dawned on me what it meant to have a geo-spatial data abstraction library. To realize what this meant I had spent a lot of time in R, reading (primarily) MapInfo TAB and MIF format files as well (of course) as shapefiles, and the occasional GeoTIFF.</description>

      <description>This post is in-progress …
Two very important packages in R are rerddap and plotdap providing straightforward access to and visualization of time-varying gridded data sets. Traditionally this is handled by individuals who either have or quickly gain expert knowledge about the minute details regarding obtaining data sources, exploring and extracting data from them, manipulating the data for the required purpose and reporting results. Often this task is not the primary goal, it’s simply a requirement for comparison to environmental data or validation of direct measurements or modelled scenarios against independent data.</description>
