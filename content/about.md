This is a [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) website for the [**hypertidy**](https://github.com/hypertidy) family of R packages for multi-dimensional and spatial data. 

Hypertidy is an approach to spatial or multi-dimensional data in R based on the following principles: 

* data sources are best managed with database *techniques*
* *spatial is not special*, user-interfaces, graphics and time-series all involve 'space'
* raster and vector are not naturally distinct, high-dimensional, curvilinear, cell-based rasters, polygon gris and ragged-arrays all cross this boundary
* 'mesh-based' or 'indexed' data structures are central, general data types while traditionally "geospatial" structures are domain-specific optimizations
* R spatial needs better APIs, a rich ecosystem of small, composable software modules
* tidy data principles are about leveraging databases and database techniques

Examples of these principles are seen in these R packages.
