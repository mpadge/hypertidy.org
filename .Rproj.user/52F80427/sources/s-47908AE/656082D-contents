This is a [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) website for the [**hypertidy**](https://github.com/hypertidy) family of R packages for multi-dimensional and spatial data. 

Hypertidy is an approach to multi-dimensional data in R based on the following principles: 

* manage information about data sources with database techniques
* spatial is not special, user-interfaces, graphics and time-series involve 'space' too
* raster and vector are not naturally distinct, high-dimensional, curvilinear, cell-based rasters, and ragged-array grids all cross this boundary
* 'mesh-based' or 'indexed' data structures are central, general data types -  raster and vector are domain-specific optimizations
* R geo-spatial needs better APIs, a rich ecosystem of small, composable software modules
* tidy data

Examples of these principles are seen in these R packages.
